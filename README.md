linter-reek
=========================

This plugin for [Linter](https://github.com/AtomLinter/Linter) provides an
interface to [Reek](https://github.com/troessner/reek). It will be used with
files that use the Ruby syntax.

## Installation
Linter must be installed in order to use this plugin. It is a hard dependency.
If Linter is not installed, please follow the instructions
[here](https://github.com/AtomLinter/Linter).

### Installing Reek
Before using this plugin, you must ensure that `reek` is installed on your
system. To install `reek`, do the following:

1. Install [ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/).

2. Install [Reek](https://github.com/troessner/reek) by typing the following in
a terminal:
   ```
   gem install reek
   ```

Now you can proceed to install the linter-reek plugin.

### Installing the Plugin
```
$ apm install linter-reek
```

## Settings
You can configure linter-reek from its settings panel or by editing
~/.atom/config.cson (choose Open Your Config in Atom menu). The only thing that
needs to be configured is the path to the `reek` executable.

### Executable Path
```
'linter-reek':
  'reekExecutablePath': /path/to/your/reek/here
```
Run `which reek` to find the path (if you're using rbenv run `rbenv which reek`).

**Note**: This plugin finds the nearest config.reek file and will automatically use it if it exists. If it does not, `reek` will run with its default settings.

1. Fork the plugin repository.
